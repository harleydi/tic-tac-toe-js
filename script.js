//Users should be able to click square and see "X" or "O"
//Every click will alternate between being for Player 1 or Player 2. The visual feedback should indicate whose turn it is.
//A cell should not be able to be replayed once marked.
//Add a reset button that will clear the contents of the board.
//After the necessary moves have been played, stop game and alert the player to a win, loss or stalemate.
    //Hint: Determine a set of winning combinations. Check those combinations on the board contents after every move.
